2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProSprint2.0.git
   cd ProSprint2.0
   ```

   pip install -e .
   ```

5. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your API keys to .env
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in the appropriate modules
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Ensure code follows the project style

### Testing

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
# Run all tests (when test suite is implemented)
pytest tests/

# Test your changes manually
prosprint run "Your test prompt"
prosprint demo
```

### Committing Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: Brief description of what you added"
```

Follow these commit message guidelines:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issues when applicable: "Fix #123: Issue description"

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
3. Provide a clear description of your changes
4. Link any related issues
5. Wait for review and address feedback

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
def process_action(action: Action) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a single action and return results.
    
    Args:
        action: Action object to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing execution results
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add examples to EXAMPLES.md
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md for structural changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Write clear docstrings

## Adding New Integrations

To add a new integration:

1. Create a new file in `prosprint/integrations/`:
   ```python
   # prosprint/integrations/your_integration.py
   from typing import Any
   from prosprint.config import config
   
   class YourIntegration:
       """Integration with Your Service."""
       
       def __init__(self):
           """Initialize the integration."""
           self.api_key = config.your_api_key
       
       def execute(self, action) -> dict[str, Any]:
           """
           Execute an action on your service.
           
           Args:
               action: Action object with parameters
               
           Returns:
               Result dictionary
           """
           # Implementation
           return {
               "status": "completed",
               "message": "Action executed successfully"
           }
   ```

2. Add configuration to `prosprint/config.py`:
   ```python
   self.your_api_key = os.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY", "")
   ```

3. Register in `prosprint/core/executor.py`:
   ```python
   from prosprint.integrations.your_integration import YourIntegration
   
   # In __init__:
   self.your_integration = YourIntegration()
   
   # In execute:
   elif action.type == ActionType.YOUR_ACTION:
       result = self.your_integration.execute(action)
   ```

4. Add action type to `prosprint/core/action.py`:
   ```python
   class ActionType(str, Enum):
       YOUR_ACTION = "your_action"
   ```

5. Update documentation
6. Add tests
7. Submit PR
